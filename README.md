# CS 4641 Project: Artificial Neural Intelligence Machine Entity

by Abhay Sheshadri, Nick Chapman, Abdul Sayed, Kevin Xiao

### Introduction/Background:

Our idea is to create an AI model that colorizes and upscales a low-resolution black-and-white anime portrait image. The people have been starved of colored content for their black and white manga pictures. The only way to see a manga page colored is either to color it yourself or to wait for the anime adaptation/anime release of that chapter. However, a vast majority of manga readers only have beginner/no artistic skills and waiting for the anime adaptation requires long waits. Especially when there are low quality scans of various manga on the internet, there is great demand to both color and upscale them for western consumer use.

### Problem definition:

Our problem is an image-to-image task. There are several architectures that were previously used for this task such as CycleGan, PatchGAN, Pix2Pix. These methods involve having to simultaneously learn the multiple distributions of images and the mappings between them. We instead use methods that leverage a model which already has learned the distribution of images, which will allow us to produce high-quality images instead of blurry or discolored one.

All of this teamâ€™s members share a similar sentiment, that low quality scans of great works be brought to life for many to enjoy!

### Methods:

Using our dataset of anime portraits, we can generate ground-truth image pairs for our task by downsampling the images and making them greyscale. We then plan to use generative models to produce high resolution colored images from the input. Instead of sampling from the unconditional distribution of anime portraits, we plan to condition the model on a particular low-resolution black and white anime image. We will first train a generative adversarial network such as a StyleGAN3 model on the high-quality anime faces and then create another auxilliary model similar to what is proposed in Pix2Style2Pix [1] or PULSE [3] to invert the low-quality images into the StyleGAN latent space. We can optionally use methods such as EditGAN [2] to further edit the output images. We can then sample possible high-quality outputs that correspond to the low-resolution input. We will implement the aforementioned models with the PyTorch and NumPy frameworks; we may also use MatPlotLib for data visualization.

### Results and Discussion:

At a basic level, our algorithm aims to return a colored, upscaled image starting from a low resolution, grayscale base. The way it was done was that it was trained by a GAN, an unsupervised method, called StyleGAN3 that we got from [here](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3) to generate the image from random values and then trained a classifier, a supervised method, called ResNet 50 to predict the random noise from the generated image. We measured the accuracy of our method using mean squared error latent losses between the target and predicted image which gave us the best value at epoch 21 of 0.245 latent loss. The MSE latent loss during training over the number of epochs is shown below:

Although the latent loss is high, there is a drastic drop in the graph as the amount of epochs increase in training. Considering the very large dataset if we were to run the algorithm with a large number of epochs the latent loss would dip to reasonable levels. We could not determine why the noise present in the MSE latent loss graph was occuring but it will theoretically decrease as the amount of epochc increase as well. As is, our results seem to be promising through observation but the significance in which the color changes once the image is recolored is very variable. This can be seen below:

Matching colors from the original picture and the recolored picture isn't necessarily the goal of this project but it would be nice to be able to match them. In the future we will look into matching the colors with the original ones in the dataset.

Since our goal is to produce several possible high-quality images for a given low-quality image, we need our model to be expressive. We will measure the expressiveness of our generative model using metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance.

### Dataset:

We intend to achieve this by using the anime-faces dataset by Gwern created from scraping various other online resources.
